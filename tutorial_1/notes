# Lesson 1

Allways initalize gstreamer with argc and argv (gst_init (&argc, &argv);

gst_parse_launch:
source -> pipeline -> sink
This is an "easy" pipeline.

playbin:
Element which acts as source and sink.
Creates and connects all necessary elements.
Takes uri=path to playup file as argument either online or local: http:// or file://.

Need to set element in GST_STATE_PLAYING state otherwise it wont start
